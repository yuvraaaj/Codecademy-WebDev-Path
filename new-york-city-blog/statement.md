**NEW YORK CITY BLOG**
*(Problem Statement)*

-After researching New York City, you decide to create a blog for your viewers who want to know more about the city. It’s time to create a blog to show off how amazing the Big Apple is. You got this!

-Don’t forget to save your code after each step. By pressing save to run your code you will see the changes you’ve made in the browser.

-Note: While you are developing the webpage, you will notice that the elements are automatically assigned colors, borders, and positioned properly. This is because of the CSS file. Don’t worry about CSS right now, it’s only there so that the webpage looks nice.
